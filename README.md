# Lens Programming Language

Lens is a highly modular, expressive, asynchronous, and easy-to-use purely functional scripting language.
This repository contains a JavaScript implementation, which is currently under heavy development and is therefore subject to significantly change over time.

If you would like to contribue to the language's development or have any general questions about the project, please feel free to shoot me an email. Thanks!
